   <div class="container"> 
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <li><span class="d1">CSS is not neccessary</span> <span class="d2">CSS saves lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web page all at once.</li>
        <li> <span class="d3"> Style Sheet stoerd in CSS files.</span></li>
    </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documens in 3 ways:</h2>
    <div class="container2">
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside the HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal- by using style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>The most comman way to add CSS. is tokeep the styles in External css files. However. <span class="d4"> in this toturial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easiar to demostrate, and easiar for you to try itself.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container3">
    <p>When compairing CSS class vs ID, the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elemens. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique elements. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.</p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elementand on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target element to which a style should be applied.</p>
